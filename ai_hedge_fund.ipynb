      "First, I need to check the search results provided. Result [1] from Moneycontrol has the latest data as of March 1, 2025. It shows the previous close at 381.38, but looking at the table, there's a discrepancy because the Open is listed as 393.12. Wait, maybe there's a time zone difference or a delay in the data. The current price isn't directly stated here, but result [3] from MarketBeat mentions the closing price on March 5, 2025, as $386.82. However, result [5] from Investing.com shows March 5, 2025, with a closing price of $381.73. Hmm, conflicting data here. Need to check the dates carefully. \n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, the current date mentioned in the query is March 8, 2025, but the search results might not have data beyond March 5. So the most recent closing price available is March 5. Let me verify: Result [3] says March 5 closing at $386.82, but result [5] shows March 5 as $381.73. That's confusing. Maybe different sources have different data. I'll need to check which one is more reliable. MarketBeat and Investing.com are both financial sites, but perhaps the data is delayed. Alternatively, maybe the time of day affects the prices. Since the user wants the most up-to-date, I should go with the latest available in the search results. \n",

      "Looking at result [1], the \"As on 01 Mar, 2025\" shows a previous close of 390.37, but the table below has a Previous Close of 381.38. That seems conflicting. Wait, maybe the first part of result [1] is a summary, and the table is more detailed. The table shows Previous Close as 390.37, Open at 393.12, High 396.84, Low 388.33. But the date here is 01 Mar, which is March 1. The user's current date is March 8, so maybe the data is a week old. However, the search results don't include data beyond March 5. So the latest available is March 5. \n",

However, result [1] doesn't provide P/B for Home Depot. Wait, the peers table in result [1] shows Home Depot's TTM PE as 23.87 and TTM EPS as 16.61. The Dividend Yield is 2.22. The P/B ratio isn't listed here, but result [2] explains that a low P/B ratio indicates undervaluation. Since the user asked for P/B, I need to check if any of the search results provide it. Result [1] doesn't show P/B for Home Depot, but the peers table includes P/B for others. Maybe I can infer it's not available in the provided data, so I might have to omit it or mention that it's not provided. Alternatively, check other results. Result [3] and [5] don't mention P/B. So perhaps it's not available here, so I can't include it. \n",

For example, on March 5, it closed at $381.73 (from result [5]), down 1.20% from the previous day.

      "\n",
      "First, I'll check the provided search results. The first result is a study from 2019 discussing social media and news sentiment's impact on market timing. It mentions that news-based sentiment is more reliable than social media for monthly stock predictions. Social media data is noisier and often dominated by news sources. This could be relevant if recent news about HD is influencing sentiment more than social media.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second result is a 2023 report on journalism and media trends, highlighting inflation, digital subscriptions, and AI in journalism.

      "🌐 Macro-Economic Analysis:\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "<think>\n",
      "Okay, let's tackle this query about the current macroeconomic environment. The user wants an analysis that includes key indicators like GDP growth, inflation rates, interest rates, unemployment trends, and central bank policies, and how these factors impact the market and assets. \n",
      "\n",
      "First, I need to go through the search results provided. The first result is from the OECD, dated December 2024. They project global GDP growth at 3.3% for 2025 and 2026, up slightly from 3.2% in 2024. Inflation in the OECD is expected to ease to 3.8% in 2025 and 3.0% in 2026. They mention regional variations, like the US growing at 2.8% in 2025, the euro area at 1.3%, and China slowing to 4.7%. Unemployment remains low, and labor markets are easing but still tight. They also note geopolitical risks and the need for structural reforms.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second result from Investopedia defines the macro environment, listing factors like GDP, inflation, employment, monetary, and fiscal policies. It explains how these affect business decisions and consumer spending. The third result is a UN report from February 2025, projecting global growth at 2.8% in 2025 and 2.9% in 2026, highlighting structural challenges and regional divergences. The US growth is moderating, China's is constrained, and developing regions have mixed prospects. Investment is improving but faces challenges like high debt.\n",
      "\n",
      "The fourth and fifth results are from the IMF. The fourth discusses monetary policy tools like interest rates and their effects on inflation and output. The fifth, the World Economic Outlook from April 2024, forecasts global growth at 3.2% for 2024 and 2025, with advanced economies slightly accelerating and emerging markets slowing. Inflation is expected to decline to 4.5% by 2025. They mention structural issues affecting growth, like labor and capital frictions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, I need to synthesize this information. Start with GDP growth. The OECD and IMF have slightly different projections, but both indicate moderate growth. The OECD's 3.3% for 2025 and the IMF's 3.2% are close. Regional differences are important: US, euro area, China, Japan. Inflation is easing but still above targets in some areas. The OECD mentions inflation targets being met in many economies, while the IMF notes advanced economies returning to targets sooner.\n",
      "\n",
      "Interest rates: The OECD suggests central banks should continue easing, except Japan. The IMF's monetary policy discussion highlights using interest rates to control inflation. So current policies are likely still restrictive but easing where possible. Unemployment is low, as per OECD, but labor markets are easing. The UN report mentions labor shortages and demographic issues.\n",
      "\n",
      "Central bank policies: The OECD emphasizes calibrated monetary easing to contain inflation, fiscal sustainability, and structural reforms. The IMF's monetary policy tools include interest rates and balance sheet adjustments. The UN report talks about monetary easing in many countries contributing to growth.\n",
      "\n",
      "Impact on markets and assets: Low inflation and controlled interest rates might support equity markets, but high debt and structural issues could dampen long-term growth. Geopolitical risks and trade tensions mentioned by OECD and UN could lead to volatility.

The CEO mentioned strong demand for Blackwell AI supercomputers, which contributed billions in sales in the first quarter.

      "Okay, let's tackle this query about NVIDIA's macroeconomic environment. The user wants an analysis including GDP growth, inflation, interest rates, unemployment trends, and central bank policies. They also want to know how these factors impact the market and NVIDIA specifically.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, I need to go through the provided search results to gather relevant data. The first result from the Philadelphia Fed's Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF) for Q1 2025 shows that GDP growth is expected to be 2.4% annually in 2025, up from previous estimates. Unemployment is projected to average 4.2% in 2025, slightly revised down. Job gains are expected to be around 145,000 monthly on average. This suggests a stable labor market which is positive for consumer spending and tech investments.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second result from the FOMC's December projections indicates median GDP growth of 2.1% for 2025, with unemployment at 4.3%. The Fed is maintaining a restrictive monetary policy but expects inflation to normalize. The third source from the University of Michigan predicts a slight rise in unemployment to 4.1% in Q2 2025 but expects it to firm up later. They also mention expected Fed rate cuts in 2025 and 2026, which could lower borrowing costs, beneficial for tech investments.\n",
      "\n",
      "The fourth result from the Bank of England discusses UK-specific policies, but since NVIDIA is a US company, this might be less relevant unless there's a global spillover. The fifth result from the St. Louis Fed's analysis of Blue Chip forecasts shows a consensus GDP growth of 2.1% for 2025, unemployment at 4.3%, and CPI inflation at 2.4%. The historical accuracy of forecasts is noted as uncertain, with GDP growth often outside the forecast range.\n",
      "\n",
      "Putting this together, the key indicators are moderate GDP growth (around 2.1-2.4%), stable unemployment (4.2-4.3%), and inflation cooling towards the Fed's target. Central banks like the Fed are expected to cut rates in 2025-2026, which would lower borrowing costs and stimulate investment, including in tech stocks like NVIDIA. However, the labor market's stability might keep wages firm, potentially affecting corporate profit margins. Inflation being under control reduces the pressure for aggressive rate hikes, which is positive for equity markets.\n",
      "\n",
      "For NVIDIA specifically, a stable macroeconomic environment supports consumer and corporate spending on tech products. Lower interest rates could lead to increased investment in AI and data centers, areas where NVIDIA is a leader. However, any rise in unemployment or slower GDP growth could impact demand for their products. The Fed's cautious approach to rate cuts might delay some investments, but the overall trend seems positive for growth-oriented tech companies like NVIDIA.\n",
